solution_dict = {"1": """              *** Use a reusable bottle/cup ***
You might already have a reusable water bottle, but do you use it all the time?
You can put that reusable bottle to use, save money, and reduce waste.
By taking your own water with you, you’ll also reduce your chances of purchasing more expensive beverages on-the-go.
This will eliminate the one-time use containers they come in.
While most cans and bottles can be recycled, they require a lot of energy to be produced,
shipped to the bottling facility and then to the store for purchase. """,

You can reduce the amount of waste you produce by purchasing products that come with less
packaging and/or come in packaging that can be recycled. Not all plastics are recyclable in Delaware,
so check labels before your buy. According to Delaware’s Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances website,
“Containers labeled with a 1 or a 2 are almost always accepted because they are the highest value resins.
Resins 4, 5 and 7 are now accepted in most programs in Delaware.” Plastics labeled with a 3/PVC and 6/PS are,
generally not recyclable in Delaware. Learn more about recycling programs in Delaware at

                     "3": """        *** Avoid single-use food and drink containers and utensils ***
Whenever possible, try to avoid single-use coffee cups, disposable utensils,
straws and napkins. Some businesses will even give you a discount on your coffee for bringing your own mug.
Keep a set of silverware at work along with a plate, bowl and cup that you can wash and reuse. Skip the plastic straw-
altogether or buy reusable metal ones instead. Remember, a lot of these items are made from plastic,
had to be delivered by a truck, and will end up in a landfill once we have used them one time.
Anything we can do to reduce our use of these products adds up to make a big impact. """,
                     "4": """         *** Buy things in bulk with less packaging ***
You can also stock up on food in the freezer. Buy a bunch of food at the same time and 
store, it in the freezer. Buying food in bulk means less packaging and less waste. Look up 
online if you can buy foods in bulk from anywhere locally.""",
                     "5": """                  *** Bring your own bag ***
Whenever you leave the house, make sure you are carrying your own bag.
Instead of plastic bags, we all need to be bringing our own reusable options.
Cotton bags are really great and are perfect for loose fruit and veg.
We are usually wearing a backpack with us when going out, thus put anything in it you’re buying.
If you forget, just carry using your arms instead. Don’t be embarrassed to say no to single-use plastic. """,
                     "6": """                      *** Composting ***
Composting is an easy and natural process that takes remains of plants and kitchen waste,
and turns it into nutrient-rich food that help your plants grow.
Compost is organic materials that have been collected together and decomposed.
Composting helps you recycle your kitchen waste and reduce the amount of what is sent to landfills that proves safe for
the environment. """,

Rechargeable batteries will save you money in the long run and keep disposable batteries,
out of landfills. Disposable batteries can prove very harmful to the environment
as chemicals inside the batteries can leak.""",

get involved. Visit pro-recycling sites and talk to others in your community about the
benefits of reducing solid waste. Family, friends, neighbors, anyone. If you start to make a difference,
maybe others will follow your footsteps."""}
